## Key Features
1. View the plantwith the ability to create, edit, and delete your own!
2. Use the garden layout to gather a plan and make your own garden with a link for a companion planting list
   for guidance.
3. See the details for each plant like seed depth, when to plant, row spacing, and more!
4. The ability to see the 4 day weather forcast with current weather in Arvada, Colorado.
5. A calendar to help with tracking dates, harvest, and fertilization of each plant. 

## MVP
- Ability to view a list of the plants with full CRUD ability. 
- Ability to create the plant listings for the plant you created. 
- Create you own garden template with a clciking and dragging.
- Ability to register and login
- Use the weather forcast to help with watering and plant safety. 

## Stretch Goals
- Provide full Crud to the plant Listings. 
- Use the calendar to keep track of what you need.
- Have full Authentication with DJango. (I have the registration but not the login still in progress)
- Connect the calendar to Django when the authentication is completed. 
- Deploy my project to Raiway, Heroku, or Netlify.
- This Application is always going to be continuing.
